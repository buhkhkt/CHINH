                <div class="cach-lam">
                    Step 1: Prepare the ingredients <br/>
                    &emsp;Cut the lemongrass and pound it to release the fragrance. 
                    Divide the auttum crosscus into two parts: one part peel, finely chop it along with the chili, and mix it with the finely chopped lemongrass. 
                    Grill the remaining part to bring out the aroma. 
                    Take 300 grams of straw mushrooms, remove the outer layer, and wash them thoroughly. 
                    Then, finely chop the straw mushrooms. 
                    Clean 500g of pig's blood, cut it into bite-sized pieces, and briefly blanch them. 
                    Wash all the accompanying vegetables and add them to a pot, mixing them thoroughly.<br/>
                    Step 2: Boil blood<br/>
                    &emsp;We bring the pot of boiling water to a boil and blanch the meat briefly to prevent it from becoming fishy.<br/>
                    Step 3: Boil the broth<br/>
                    &emsp;Put 400g of prahok in a pot and cook until the fish paste boils and dissolves. 
                    Once the paste releases its aroma and the meat dissolves, turn off the heat. 
                    Boil 4 liters of water in another pot and add the crushed lemongrass. 
                    When the water is boiling, add snakehead fish, finely chopped lemongrass after mixing, and crushed, grilled auttum crosscus into the pot. 
                    After boiling for some time, the fish in the pot will be cooked. 
                    Remove all the fish and add the straw mushrooms. 
                    Strain the previously boiled fish paste into the pot. 
                    Add 1,5 teaspoons of MSG. 
                    After removing the fish, proceed to separate the meat from the bones, being careful not to leave any bones. 
                    Add the blood, which has been boiled, and the separated fish meat to the broth. 
                    Now, all you have to do is wait for the broth to boil for about 5 minutes before enjoying it.<br/>

        <div class="cach-lam">
            We put rock salt in a pan and roast it. 
            While roasting, we also crush it. 
            When the salt becomes smooth and starts to dry, we add ground chili and stir it well to evenly distribute the chili into the salt. 
            Remember to stir it continuously because if you don't, the salt will burn. 
            After the salt mixture is evenly roasted, we add finely ground sugar. 
            After about 3-5 minutes, when the mixture has a spicy and aromatic scent, we turn off the stove and can transfer it into a jar for storage.
