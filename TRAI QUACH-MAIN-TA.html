            &emsp;In the picture, we can see two halves of a wood apple with thick rinds in two different colors because the wood apple in the photo is not fully ripe yet. 
            One side of the wood apple is grayish-white, indicating the unripe part, with small scattered seeds and fibers. 
            The flesh inside is white, crispy, and slightly sour. The other half of the wood apple is dark brown, showing the ripe part, with more seeds and tough fibers in the inner flesh. 
            When eaten, it has a sweet and slightly bitter taste with a distinctive fragrance.

        <h2 >General Overview:</h2>
        <div class="khai-quat-chung">
            &emsp;The wood apple tree, a soil-picky species, can be found throughout Vietnam, from the north to the south, but the fruit is only seen in the Mekong Delta region. This is a special tree, not commonly found and grown in only a few places. The wood apple tree is often cultivated in areas like Cầu Kè and Trà Vinh, where it is usually intermixed with other fruit-bearing trees. In particular, the Khmer people enjoy planting wood apple trees

                <span class="tooltiptext"><img src="quách xung quanh nhà.webp"/></span>
            </p>
            to create shade and have the opportunity to enjoy the delicious fruit.<br/>
            &emsp;Wood apple, also known as "Gáo", doesn't have an alluring

                <span class="tooltiptext"><img src="quách hình thù.webp"/></span>
            </p>
            However, its distinctive flavor is what captivates people and keeps them coming back for more. The wood apple tree belongs to the Sapotaceae family and thrives in non-waterlogged environments.

            </p>
            grows to a height of approximately 7-10 meters, and after about 4 years of cultivation, it starts bearing fruit, with the fruit yield increasing as the tree matures. Wood apples are round in shape, smaller than a plastic soccer ball, with gray-white, rough skin. The wood apple season typically falls in December and January. When ripe, the fruit's pulp turns dark and contains numerous small seeds resembling drumsticks, which naturally fall at night. Despite falling from a considerable height, they are not prone to breaking due to their tough outer shell. Therefore, harvesting wood apples is not as challenging as with some other fruit varieties. People in Trà Vinh usually wait for wood apples to ripen and fall before harvesting them, as picking them too early and ripening them with vinegar doesn't make the fruit as fragrant and delicious as when it ripens on the tree.<br/>
            &emsp;When the wood apple reaches the desired ripeness, people often don't eat it right away. Instead, they let the fruit ripen thoroughly, allowing

                <span class="tooltiptext"><img src="quách già.jpg"/></span>
            </p>
            to become slightly moldy and soft before consuming it. While it is possible to eat the wood apple immediately, the flavor at this stage is not the best.

            </p>
            have a sour and astringent taste. The longer the wood apple ripens, the darker the flesh becomes, and the more pronounced the aroma.<br/>
            &emsp;Apart from being a delicious fruit, in folklore, wood apples are also known for their numerous medicinal uses, such as cooling the body, treating constipation, diarrhea, bronchitis, strengthening the bones, nourishing the kidneys, and many other benefits. Therefore, dishes made from wood apples, a humble fruit, are often favored in the lives of rural people. Typically, there are three ways to prepare wood apples: consuming them with fish sauce, blending them into smoothies, or soaking them in alcohol.<br/>
