        <h2>General Overview:</h2>
        <div class="khai-quat-chung">
            &emsp;"Cháo ám" is a culinary symbol of Trà Vinh. 
            Since stepping foot into this region, you won't be able to resist trying a bowl of "Cháo ám", a unique dish that even its name is intriguing.<br/>
            &emsp;"Cháo ám" is not an unfamiliar dish, but it has its own origin and a unique story hidden behind its name. 
            The name "Cháo ám" never fails to intrigue those who first set foot here. 
            Initially, it was a dish made from snakehead fish porridge, but the related story gave rise to this name. 
            In the tradition of this region, before becoming a 
            
            <p class="tooltip"><b><i>bride, </i></b>
                <span class="tooltiptext"><img src="cô dâu.jpg"/></span>
            </p>
            every woman had to face a unique challenge: to cook a delicious pot of snakehead fish porridge. 
            This, despite being simple in terms of ingredients, was not an easy task to overcome, given the scrutiny from the mother-in-law. 
            As a result, the pot of snakehead fish porridge became an obsession for young brides, and from then on, it was called "Cháo ám".<br/>
            &emsp;Despite its ancient origins, this delicious dish has undergone a long journey, making its appearance at Chau Thanh 
            
            <p class="tooltip"><b><i>Market </i></b>
                <span class="tooltiptext"><img src="chợ xưa.jpg"/></span>
            </p>
            in the 1930s. 
            Back then, fish congee was a popular breakfast option widely sold at the market and major roads within the district. 
            While the preparation method is not overly complex, to create a delicious bowl of congee, the cook must have experience selecting rice, fish, and spices properly to achieve the distinctive flavor unique to fish congee. 
            The most crucial element is choosing the main ingredient, the snakehead fish. 
            To make a delicious snakehead fish congee, the fish must be fresh and firm. 
            The people of Tra Vinh often prefer to use 
            <span class="c-tooltip-top" data-c-tooltip="Snakehead fish is a freshwater fish commonly found in rural and riverine areas."><b><i>"wild snakehead fish" </i></b></span>
            for its distinctive natural flavor.
            However, due to the increasingly scarce source of fish, people have opted for 
            
            <p class="tooltip"><b><i>farmed snakehead fish </i></b>
                <span class="tooltiptext"><img src="cá lóc nuôi.jpg"/></span>
            </p>
            as a substitute. 
            In addition to fish, the use of fragrant rice is also an essential element. 
            Rice for making congee is usually unpolished, not roasted as when making savory congee, in order to preserve its natural, delicious taste and distinctive aroma. 
            When the congee is cooked, it will have a natural and enticing white color, making you forever remember the taste of Trà Vinh's land.

            Next, sauté the purple onions until they turn golden, then add the fish. 
            Stir gently to make the fish firm.
