        <h2>General Overview:</h2>
        <div class="khai-quat-chung">
            &emsp;
            Makapuno is a unique fruit. 
            This name originates from the excellence of the coconut flesh, which is soft and rich. 
            This fruit was first discovered in the 1940s in Trà Vinh province, located in the western region of Vietnam, a land renowned for the diversity of delicious and miraculous coconuts. 
            In Trà Vinh, the unique climate and soil have created a distinct genetic mutation found only here. 
            Makapuno cannot be grown anywhere else, making it special and precious.
            <br/>
            &emsp;
            Its value far exceeds that of regular coconuts. 
            What's special is that in the process of propagating makapuno, the ones without wax are selected to be used for breeding, as they have the ability to produce seeds. 
            Makapuno, while delicious, cannot be used for propagation. 
            They are instead utilized to create other flavorful products.
            <br/>
            &emsp;
            If you've ever had the pleasure of savoring makapuno, you'll find yourself immersed in the sweet, luscious richness of the incredibly unique,

            </p>
            coconut water. 
            However, this type of fruit often yields very few coconuts, typically only about 2 to 3 per tree. 
            This rarity makes them precious and expensive, but it also highlights the value and uniqueness of makapuno, a moist treasure of Western Vietnam.

            &emsp;With a freshly harvested makapuno, you can store it at room temperature for 15–20 days. 
            If you want to extend the storage time, place the makapuno in the refrigerator, and it will last for about 25–30 days. 
            For a makapuno that has been deseeded, you can store it in the fridge for up to 3 days or in the freezer for a week. 
            However, to fully enjoy the fresh and sweet flavor of this rare fruit, it is best to consume it within 10 days. 
            Storing it for too long may cause the makapuno to lose its fresh flavor, and the coconut meat may not remain as tender as when freshly harvested.<br/>
