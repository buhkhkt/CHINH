        <div class="cach-lam">
            Step 1: Prepare the ingredients <br />
            &emsp;Soak 4 grams of wood-ear mushrooms in cold water for about 20–30 minutes to allow the mushrooms to expand. 
            Wash the green beans and carrots, then cut the carrots into evenly sized pieces with the green beans. 
            Place a pan on the stove with about 200 ml of water and add ½ teaspoon of salt. 
            Add the carrots to the pan and turn on the heat. Once the water comes to a boil, add the green beans. 
            After 1 minute, drain the water and rinse the vegetables with cold water to keep them fresh and crisp.
            Next, add 1 tablespoon of white wine to the salted egg yolks to remove any odors. 
            Then, steam the salted egg yolks for 7-8 minutes (if baking, leave them at 160°C for 9–10 minutes).<br />
            Step 2: Fry the eggs to make the crust<br />
            &emsp;Add 1/5 of a teaspoon of salt and whisk the eggs until they are well combined. 
            Next, heat 1 tablespoon of cooking oil on the stove. 
            Pour the eggs onto the stove and spread them evenly, then wait until the surface of the eggs sets before removing them from the heat.<br />
            Step 3: Prepare Vietnamese pork paste<br />
            &emsp;After soaking the wood-ear mushrooms, remove the stems and cut them into small pieces. 
            Then, add them to 400g of Vietnamese pork paste and mix in ½ teaspoon of onion powder and ½ teaspoon of white pepper. 
            Mix well.<br />
            Step 4: Wrap the multi-color "Chả hoa"<br />
            &emsp;Place a clean sheet of food wrap on a flat surface, then layer the fried eggs on it, followed by Vietnamese pork paste, a layer of carrots and green beans, and another layer of Vietnamese pork paste. 
            The final layer consists of carrots and green beans. 
            Add a salted egg yolk in the center of the top layer. 
            Roll the wrap tightly, making sure it's round and secure. 
            Then transfer the wrapped roll to aluminum foil. 
            Tie it tightly with string. 
            Steam for about 30 minutes, then allow it to cool for about 5 hours before enjoying.

        <h2>How To Make Dipping Sauce:</h2>
        <h3> Pepper and salt with lemon:</h3>


        <div class="cach-lam">
            We roast the peppercorns to preserve their aroma. 
            We combine coarse salt and fine salt, then roast them for about 7–10 minutes until the salt is dry. 
            Next, we let the roasted peppercorns cool and then ground them while finely chopping some lemon leaves. 
            Finally, we mix all the components with the initial salt mixture and continue to roast them. 
            You can add a bit of chili powder for some spiciness. 
            After a while, turn off the heat and let it cool. 
            Grind some sugar, then pour it into the roasted salt mixture and mix thoroughly. 
            Now we have a delicious peppercorn salt blend. 
            At this point, we sieve the salt mixture into a container for storage. 
            When serving, just squeeze some lemon over the peppercorn salt to enjoy this special blend.

            &emsp;"Chả hoa" is a dish made from pork, pate, salted eggs, fried eggs, vegetables, and wood-ear mushrooms, all wrapped in banana leaves and steamed to perfection. 
            To ensure the longevity of "Chả hoa", there are some important steps to keep in mind. 
            "Chả hoa" should be stored in the refrigerator at a temperature ranging from 0 to 4 degrees Celsius (32 to 39.2 degrees Fahrenheit). 
            This helps keep "Chả hoa" fresh and prevents spoilage. 
            Before placing it in the refrigerator, be sure to tightly wrap "Chả hoa" in plastic wrap or a plastic bag to prevent it from drying out and losing moisture. 
            "Chả hoa" can be stored in the refrigerator and used for up to three days. 
            After three days, it may start to dry out and lose its delicious flavor. 
            If you want to extend its shelf life, you can store it in the freezer compartment of the refrigerator. 
            However, when using it, be sure to thaw "Chả hoa" naturally in the refrigerator or use a microwave for defrosting.
