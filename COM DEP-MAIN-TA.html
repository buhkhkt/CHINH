                    Step 1: Prepare the ingredients<br/>
                    &emsp;We take 150g of pre-prepared mung beans and wash them thoroughly. We sift through the sweet rice flakes to identify any damaged or blackened grains, and discard them.<br/>
                    Step 2: Make the filling<br/>
                    &emsp;I prepared the mung beans in a pot, filled it with water until submerged. Once the beans started boiling, I skimmed off the foam to make the filling smoother. I continued cooking until the water dried up and was absorbed by the beans. After cooking, I mashed the beans evenly. Next, I put the mung beans in a pan with 3 tablespoons of sugar and a pinch of salt, mixing thoroughly for an even blend. Then, I added 3 tablespoons of coconut milk to the filling until it dried up.<br/>
                    Step 3: Wrap the filling<br/>
                    &emsp;We take the kernel and shape it into evenly round pieces.<br/>
                    Step 4: Make the cake border<br/>
                    &emsp;Pour coconut milk into the pot along with a little salt and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Cook until the sugar and coconut milk heat up and dissolve. Next, evenly pour the coconut milk over sweet rice flakes and mix well to allow the sweet rice flakes to expand evenly. Let it sit for a while to allow the coconut milk to absorb, then knead the sweet rice flakes evenly to make it more elastic. Once the sweet rice flakes are soft and form a cohesive mass, it's ready.<br/>
                    Step 5: Wrap the cakes<br/>
                    &emsp;We take a piece of dough, flatten it, then place the filling in and wrap it up, forming a round shape. Next, we roll the dough into a long shape. We take a banana leaf, roll the dough inside, and fold it into four corners, securing it with a rubber band. Then, we use a string to tie the cake.<br/>
                    Step 6: Steam the cakes<br/>
                    &emsp;We just need to steam the cake for 15 minutes, and then we can take it out to enjoy.<br/>

            &emsp;In general, sweet rice flakes should be stored in a dry, cool place and separated into different types. It's not advisable to stock too many fresh sweet rice flakes at room temperature as they can quickly spoil. Here are some specific ways to preserve sweet rice flakes:<br/>
            <b>For fresh sweet rice flakes used during the day:</b><br/>
            &emsp;To keep sweet rice flakes fresh and flavorful, it's best to wrap them in 
            <p class="tooltip"><b><i>edible canna</i></b>
                <span class="tooltiptext"><img src="lá dong riềng.jpg"/></span>
            </p>
            or
            
            <p class="tooltip"><b><i>lotus leaves, </i></b>
                <span class="tooltiptext"><img src="lá sen.jpg"/></span>
            </p>
            as the seller might have already done when you purchased them. This method not only prevents the sweet rice flakes from drying out but also enhances their aroma with the infused fragrance of lotus leaves.<br/>
            &emsp;However, because it's fresh sweet rice flakes, it's best to use them on the same day rather than overnight. You should consume sweet rice flakes within 6 hours if left at room temperature during summer or early fall, as prolonged exposure may cause them to spoil quickly due to the high temperature.<br/>
            &emsp;If you store sweet rice flakes in a place with air conditioning, which may lead to them drying out, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly. Then, moisten your hands with filtered water, mix the sweet rice flakes evenly, and wrap them back up with lotus leaves as originally packaged before continuing to use.<br/>
            <b>Store sweet rice flakes in the refrigerator:</b><br/>
            &emsp;If you want to store sweet rice flakes in the refrigerator for long-term use, from 6 months to 1 year, put the fresh sweet rice flakes in plastic bags or containers, then place them in the freezer compartment of the refrigerator.<br/>
            &emsp;When you need to use sweet rice flakes, simply take out the desired amount, spread it evenly on a tray, and thaw it by gently blowing air with a fan. Then, it's ready for use.<br/>
