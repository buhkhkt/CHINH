        <h2 >General Overview:</h2>
        <div class="khai-quat-chung">
            &emsp;Trà Vinh, a region in the southern part of Vietnam, has long been famous for its delicious and unique specialties. However, if you have ever set foot in this place, you are sure to have heard about a special type of fish sauce from this region, which is known as sandworm sauce.<br/>
            &emsp;The town of Duyên Hai, in Trà Vinh province, is renowned for a unique aquatic creature -

            </p>
            For generations, the local people here have been harnessing this aquatic species to create a unique kind of fish sauce. There's an intriguing legend about its origin, in which, when King Nguyễn Ánh was venturing into this land, a loyal subject provided him with a taste of this distinctive fish sauce. After ascending the throne as King Gia Long, every year, he sent boats southward to procure the sandworm sauce for consumption, following a royal ritual known as

            That's why sandworm sauce is called the king's fish sauce and has become a unique and precious product.<br/>
            &emsp;Sandworms is a species of earthworm that lives underground in brackish and tidal areas, following rivers and coastal sandbanks. The unique characteristic of sandworms is that they only appear during the lunar months of October and November, resulting in the production of sandworm sauce happening only once a year. Pure sandworm sauce has a
            <span class="c-tooltip-top" data-c-tooltip="the amount of protein in the product is being referred to"><b><i>high protein content,</i></b></span>
            creating a delicious and salty flavor that surpasses regular fish sauce.
            The process of making sandworm sauce is also simple, with a quantity of sand worms mixed with salt in a fixed ratio, then left to ferment outdoors. This makes the sandworm sauce progressively thicker and takes on a golden color like

                <span class="tooltiptext"><img src="màu mật ông.jpg"/></span>
            </p>
            carrying a unique, gentle aroma.
            Each bottle of sandworm sauce is a symbol of the hard work and dedication of the fish sauce makers. With the support of the provincial agricultural association, sandworm sauce is now bottled, filtered through a UV sterilization machine, and sealed with a branded label. This helps enhance the quality of fish sauce and keeps it fresh and delicious.<br/>
            &emsp;While sandworm sauce is only produced once a year, the local residents hold it in high esteem, and it is served only for special guests. Every year, the sandworm sauce is carefully preserved and taken to various parts of the country as a symbol of pride for the land of Trà Vinh.<br/>

                    We proceed to ferment fish sauce. We mix sandworms and salt in a ratio of 7:3 (for example, if we have 70kg of sandworms, we will use 30kg of salt). Then, we stir to dissolve the salt evenly. We wait for a while for the water to settle on top, skim off the foam, and then seal the barrel tightly. We ferment the fish sauce for 10 months. After about 10 months, we proceed to filter the sauce and transfer it into bottles. Nowadays, with advanced technology, we can sterilize it using UV rays, making the filtering process modern and more reliable.
