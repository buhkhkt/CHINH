        <div class="khai-quat-chung">
            &emsp;"Bánh rây", a traditional Khmer delicacy, is found in many provinces and regions where Khmer people reside. However, these days, "Bánh rây" has become quite rare, with only a few places still selling them in Trà Vinh. In the past, these cakes were known as "Ọm Chiếl" (as referred to by the Khmer community). Over time, based on the various processing steps involved, they came to be known as "Bánh rây" or leaf cakes made from pandan leaves. They are called "Bánh rây" because a mesh basket is used to

            </p>
            into the pan. The name "pandan leaf cake" comes from the fact that for this type of cake to be delicious, the glutinous rice must be ground together with

            </p>
            The simple ingredients for preparation include glutinous rice, pandan leaves, grated coconut, peanuts, and sugar. The necessary tools for preparation are just a pan, a strainer,

            </p>
            and a stove.
            The ingredients and tools may be simple, but to create delicious cakes, one must go through a meticulous and detailed preparation process. "Bánh rây" is often sold in a takeaway style.<br/>
            &emsp;When visiting Tra Vinh or any of the provinces in the Mekong Delta, this simple yet delightful snack is a must-try for travelers. It allows you to experience the authentic culinary culture of the generous and hospitable Khmer people. This pastry is often present on the ancestral altars and offerings during the festive days of the Khmer community, honoring their ancestors and elders.<br/>

                <h3>The steps to follow:</h3>
                <div class="cach-lam">
                    Step 1: Roast peanuts <br/>
                    &emsp;First, roast 50 grams of peanuts over medium heat, adding a teaspoon of salt to make the peanuts turn golden faster. When the peanut shells have become evenly browned, you can then squeeze and remove the shells.<br/>
                    Step 2: Make the filling<br/>
                    &emsp;Take 150g of grated coconut and mix it thoroughly with 100g of white sugar, then let it sit for 15 minutes. After that, add the coconut mixture to a pan and stir it evenly. When the coconut becomes dry, add a vanilla tube to enhance the aroma. Continue stirring until the coconut starts to thicken, then add the peanuts.<br/>
                    Step 3: Mix the dough<br/>
                    &emsp;Put 200 grams of glutinous rice flour, 10 grams of tapioca flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 150ml of pandan leaf water into a bowl. Pour the water slowly and mix everything by hand, kneading the dough until it becomes smooth.<br/>
                    Step 4: Sift the flour and roll the coconut filling<br/>
                    &emsp;Pass the flour through a sifter. Then, heat the stove and sift the flour evenly into a hot pan, cover it, and wait for about 1 minute. Then, place the filling in the center of the cake. Then, fold the cake in four corners, and we have completed a "Bánh rây".<br/>
