            . 
            In Trà Vinh, there's "Bánh tét Trà Cuôn", which, according to local tradition, was created by a Khmer woman named Mrs. Thạch Thị Lết in Cầu Ngang district as a means of livelihood. 
            Over its 80-year history, this cake has become a beloved specialty in the Mekong Delta, cherished by locals and visitors alike.
            "Bánh tét Trà Cuôn" not only represents a delicious dish but also symbolizes the pride and culinary heritage of Trà Vinh.            
            <br/>
            &emsp;To create the perfect "Bánh tét", the baker must undergo an intricate process, seeking out the finest ingredients to craft a culinary masterpiece. 
            Right from its appearance, "Bánh tét Trà Cuôn" exudes a sense of solidity and balance when you hold it in your hand. 
            The banana leaf wrapping is tightly secured with

            and adorned with a label that makes the "Bánh tét Trà Cuôn" brand shine.

                <h3>Steps to make "Bánh tét" with meat filling:</h3>
                <div class="cach-lam">
                    Step 1: Prepare the ingredients <br/>
                    &emsp;Wash 2kg of glutinous rice thoroughly. 
                    Next, clean 400g of mung beans. 
                    Take the yolks of salted eggs, rinse them with white wine, and steam them with sesame oil until the yolks of the salted eggs are evenly cooked.<br/>
                    Step 2: Soak glutinous rice and mung beans<br/>
                    &emsp;After cleaning the glutinous rice, add water and 1 teaspoon of salt. 
                    Soak the rice overnight, approximately 10 hours. 
                    The mung beans, after shelling, should also be soaked in water for about 3–4 hours. 
                    After 3–4 hours, when the mung beans have swollen, drain the water and let the beans sit to drain excess water. 
                    After one night, place the glutinous rice in a strainer to drain excess water and rinse with clean water.<br/>
                    Step 3: Cook the bean filling<br/>
                    &emsp;In a pot, add the mung beans along with 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of cooking oil, and 800ml of water. 
                    Cover the pot tightly and bring the mung beans to a boil. 
                    Once the mung beans start boiling, uncover the pot and skim off any foam that rises to the top. 
                    Then, cover the pot again, but not completely sealed, leaving a small vent. 
                    After about 15 more minutes, the mung beans will have absorbed most of the water. 
                    Seal the pot tightly again and continue cooking for another 10 minutes. 
                    Add 1 tablespoon of sugar to the mung beans, stir well, and turn off the heat. 
                    Stir the mung beans until they cool and dry.<br/>
                    Step 4: Prepare the meat filling<br/>
                    &emsp;Slice 500 grams of pork belly into thin slices; the thinner, the better. 
                    After finishing the slicing, proceed to marinate the meat by adding 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of seasoning granules, 1 teaspoon of ground pepper, minced purple onions and garlic, and a dash of MSG. 
                    Let it sit for about 30 minutes. 
                    Take the marinated meat and briefly pan-fry it to make it fragrant and firm.<br/>
                    Step 5: Sauté the glutinous rice<br/>
                    &emsp;Pour 500ml of pandan leaf water into a saucepan, along with 500ml of coconut milk, 100g of sugar, and 30g of salt. 
                    Once the mixture comes to a boil, add the glutinous rice and stir well until the rice absorbs all the coconut milk and pandan leaf water.<br/>
                    Step 6: Wrap "Bánh tét"<br/>
                    &emsp;After the mung beans have dried, I put the filling on a food wrap, evenly spreading out the filling, and then place the meat and salted eggs on top, folding the edges of the filling to make it square. 
                    I arrange the banana leaves both on the outside and inside, then spread the glutinous rice thinly. 
                    Next, after wrapping the filling, I fold both ends of the cake tightly to ensure it's secure. 
                    Finally, I use a string to tie the "Bánh tét" firmly in place. <br/>
                    Step 7: Steam "Bánh tét"<br/>
                    &emsp;With the traditional method of steaming "Bánh tét", we can place it in a steamer and line it with banana leaves, then fill the steamer with water along with the "Bánh tét". 
                    However, this steaming method can take a long time, ranging from 8 to 9 hours. 
                    Therefore, we can use the following method to save time while maintaining the same delicious flavor of "Bánh tét".<br/>
                    &emsp;Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil. 
                    Once the water is boiling, place the "Bánh tét" on top of the pot and cover it tightly. 
                    After about 1 hour, remove the lid and flip the "Bánh tét" to even out the cooking. 
                    Then, cover it tightly and steam for another 1.5–2 hours. 
                    When the time is up, turn off the heat, keep the "Bánh tét" covered, and let it sit overnight to allow the filling to fully cook and the glutinous rice to become softer and more elastic.<br/>

                    Next, we spread the banana filling on top, then fold the two ends of the "Banh tet" tightly together to encase the filling. 
                    Finally, we use a string to secure the "Banh tet" tightly in place.<br/>
