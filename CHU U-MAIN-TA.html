                <div class="cach-lam">
                    Step 1: Prepare the ingredients <br/>
                    &emsp;Soak "Chù ụ" in ice water. 
                    Next, we separate the bud portion, then transfer the "Chù ụ" to a bowl while cutting off the head of the "Chù ụ" corner.<br/>
                    Step 2: Make tamarind sauce<br/>
                    &emsp;I pour about 100 ml of warm water into a bowl and then gently dissolve the tamarind in the water. 
                    I add 2 tablespoons of sugar and 2 tablespoons of fish sauce to the bowl, and then mix it well to dissolve the sugar and fish sauce.<br/>
                    Step 3: Fry the "Chù ụ" <br/>
                    &emsp;I lift the pan and pour cooking oil into it. 
                    I wait until the oil heats up, then I add the "Chù ụ" to fry until it turns golden evenly, and then I transfer it to a plate.<br/>
                    Step 4: Roast the "Chù ụ"<br/>
                    &emsp;In a pan, add some cooking oil and finely chopped garlic, then sauté the garlic until fragrant.

                    Finally, just mix in the "Chù ụ" and stir well to ensure it absorbs the flavors, and you have completed the delicious "Chù ụ rang me".<br/>
